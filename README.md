# Realtime_Digital_Filter_Design

Realtime Digital Filter Design is a powerful desktop application designed to empower users to craft custom digital filters in real-time through intuitive zeros-poles manipulation and frequency response visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Z-Plane Plot:** Visualize and manipulate zeros and poles on the Z-plane plot, with options to modify, delete, or clear elements, and control the addition of conjugates.
  
- **Frequency Response Graphs:** View corresponding magnitude and phase response graphs for the placed elements, providing insights into the filter characteristics.
  
- **Real-time Filtering:** Apply the designed filter on lengthy signals with real-time visualization, allowing users to control the speed and temporal resolution of the filtering process.
  
- **All-Pass Filter Correction:** Correct phase distortion by adding All-Pass filters, with options to choose from a library or create custom All-Pass filters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application.
4. Design custom digital filters by manipulating zeros and poles on the Z-plane plot.
5. Visualize the frequency response of the designed filter.
6. Apply the filter to real-time signals and control the filtering speed.
7. Correct phase distortion using All-Pass filters as needed.
